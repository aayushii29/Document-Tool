# Document-Tool
This program includes a search engine that will return all matching answers to an input query in
a corpus of multiple books provided(say complete works
of Mahatama Gandhi), similar to the way search engines return the results. The search engine is implemented using Rabin-Karp Pattern Search Algorithm, claimed to be more robust than Google or Bing for the specific corpus. 
The input query may start from middle of a word and end at the middle of a word, yet the search engine is expected to return all the sentences in the given corpus that match your input query.In addition, I the program includes a dictionary(implemented using Red-Black trees)that counts the number of occurrences of each word in the given corpus.
